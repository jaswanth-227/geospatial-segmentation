# 🛰️ Geospatial Feature Extraction using Multi-Model Deep Learning 

🚀 A scalable end-to-end geospatial AI system for extracting **buildings, road networks, road centerlines, and water bodies** from ultra-high-resolution satellite imagery and converting outputs into **GIS-ready vector formats (.gpkg)**.

---

## 🏆 Hackathon Objective (IIT Tirupati)

To automate extraction of geospatial features from satellite imagery for:

- 🏙️ Smart city planning  
- 🛣️ Road network analysis & mapping  
- 🌊 Water resource monitoring  
- 🌍 GIS-based spatial intelligence systems  

---
## 🧠 System Architecture (Designed for Ultra-Large Satellite Images)

This system is specifically designed to process **very large GeoTIFF images (10k × 20k+ resolution)** using memory-efficient inference.

---

### 🛰️ 1. Input Layer
```
GeoTIFF Image (10k × 20k+ resolution)
```

---

### 🔲 2. Tiling Engine (Critical for Large Images)
- Splits large satellite images into overlapping patches
- Enables GPU-safe inference
- Prevents memory overflow
- Ensures spatial consistency during reconstruction

```
Large Image → [Tile Generator] → Small Patches
```

---

### 🧠 3. Model Routing Layer
Dynamically selects the appropriate deep learning model based on task:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Model Router                  │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🏢 Building Segmentation (UNet / CNN)      │
│ 🛣️ Road Segmentation (DINOv2-based)        │
│ 🌊 Water Segmentation (DeepLabV3+)         │
│ 🌊 Water Line Extraction (82 IoU)          │
│ 🛣️ Road Centerline Extraction (64 IoU)     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 🧹 4. Post-Processing Layer
Applied after inference to refine outputs:

- Morphological filtering (noise removal)
- Skeletonization (for road centerlines)
- Contour extraction
- Polygonization (vector conversion)

---

### 🗺️ 5. GIS Output Layer
Final outputs are converted into GIS-compatible formats:

```
Raster Outputs:
- Segmentation Masks (.tif)

Vector Outputs:
- GeoPackage (.gpkg)
```
